   <h3>Description</h3>
   <p>I made up this recipe many years ago, because I loved the corn dogs you buy at carnivals but could not find a recipe for them. Great served with mustard.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup yellow cornmeal</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>2 (16 ounce) packages beef frankfurters</li>
        <li>16 wooden skewers</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine cornmeal, flour, salt, pepper, sugar and baking powder. Stir in eggs and milk. </li>
        <li>Preheat oil in a deep saucepan over medium heat. Insert wooden skewers into frankfurters. Roll frankfurters in batter until well coated. </li>
        <li>Fry 2 or 3 corn dogs at a time until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels. </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cook's Note</h3>
    <p>We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention value of 10% after cooking. The exact amount may vary depending on cook time and temperature, ingredient density, and the specific type of oil used. </p>
